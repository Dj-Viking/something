# Learning Swift

---

* 3/3/2022
  - trying to learn how to code swift. Ran into some compatibility issues with a example swiftui project had to use `objectVersion: 52` set in the project.pbxproj file, which apparently enumerates to xcode version 11.3.1 which is what is installed on my catalina machine.
  - the project starts, but I cannot choose a simulator for it for some reason, could be a compatibility issue there also
  - Started a brand new project to see if I can get a build. and it works, while streaming the simulator took a few minutes to start. which seems to be normal from what I have seen. 

  - My idea is to try and port over the map project that Crystal Knight worked on for the ios devs meetup. to get it to build on my machine. I am currently hesitant to upgrade my machine to big sur to run xcode 12+ because of possible backwards compatibility issues with ableton live and other software that I frequently use. 
  - And then eventually try to build an application that is a clone of touchOSC just to see if I can build it myself and learn how that works.
